# To-Do_List
This web-based To-Do List app streamlines task management. Users can add tasks with descriptions and assignees, edit incomplete tasks via a form overlay, and delete tasks, all with local storage persistence. Mark tasks as completed or incomplete, toggle between views, and filter tasks by assignee names.
